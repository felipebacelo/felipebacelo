## Hello World!

My name is Felipe, I am 29 years old and I live in the city of SÃ£o Paulo / Brazil. I am currently majoring in Software Engineering. From an early age I was always interested in the technology area, recently I returned my studies to the area, focusing on the development and maintenance of software and automation solutions.
